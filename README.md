# Discord-Badges-Plugin
Adds all Discord badges to your profile
This is something I am testing for better discord, no plugin works now and I wanted to fix it and that is my plan to just add every badge.
No point in making it an option to add certain badges, if youd like you can change that yourself.
I might change it in the future but for right now I am not going to.
